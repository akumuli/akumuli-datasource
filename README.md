# Akumuli Grafana Datasource Plugin

This is a datasource plugin for Grafana that can be used to visualize data from the [Akumuli](https://github.com/akumuli/Akumuli) time-series database.

Supported features of the datasource:

- Native downsampling using one of the supported functions (avg, min, max, etc).
- Query data in the original form (without downampling).
- Rate calculation for counters.
- Simple anomaly detection using EWMA prediction (it's easy to set up and works great with Grafana's alerts).
- Autocomplete for metric names, tag names and values for easier discovery.

Other Akumuli functions and aggregations will be added in the future.

### Set up

To install the plugin simply clone this repository to your Grafana's plugins directory. It's located at `{grafana}/data/plugins`.
